# Core Platform Wiki (Phase 1)

Welcome to the Core Platform wiki.

This project is a Core + Modules system inspired by Odoo:
- **Core** provides the runtime (workspace context, app registry, install store, and app runner).
- **Modules/Apps** are optional features registered into the core.
- **Widgets** (Phase 1 concept) are embeddable UI blocks that modules can provide later.

## Phase 1 Scope
Phase 1 focuses on a working core runtime with:
- App registry
- Local installation (per workspace)
- Enable/disable state
- Workspace app gate/runner
- Control Center dashboard (admin)

No billing, no Firestore, no Stripe enforcement in Phase 1.
