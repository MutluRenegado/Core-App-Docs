# Control Center (Admin)

## Route
/admin/core

## Purpose
A single place to manage core items by workspace:
- list apps from the registry
- install apps into a workspace
- enable/disable apps
- quick open app runner pages

## How to Use
1) Open /admin/core
2) Set workspaceId (e.g. "test")
3) Install an app
4) Enable it
5) Open it using the "Open →" link

## Notes
- Control Center is Phase 1 management tooling.
- It should remain simple and stable.
- It should not implement billing or permissions in Phase 1.
