# Apps & Modules (Phase 1)

## Where apps are defined
Apps are defined in the App Registry (APPS record).

Each app includes:
- id
- name / icon / description
- requiredTier (metadata only in Phase 1)
- routes (workspace-aware links)
- component (React component entry)

## Adding a New App (Phase 1)
1) Add a new React component entry
2) Add a new item to APPS

### Requirements
- If JSX is used in the registry file, the file must be .tsx (not .ts).

## Testing an App
1) Install app in Control Center for workspace "test"
2) Open:
   /admin/workspace/test/apps/<appId>

## Best Practice
- Core should never hardcode app behavior outside the registry contract.
- Apps should remain independent and safely removable.
